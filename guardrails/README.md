# agent-guardrails

The kit's structural gate. One module, copied verbatim into every generated project,
enforcing the rules a linter structurally cannot see: the folder tree, per-domain shape,
colocated tests, barrels, banned dependencies, required files, committed secrets, and
contextual code patterns.

Anything oxlint / oxfmt / clippy / rustfmt already enforces stays with them. Two enforcers
of one rule is how ceilings drift apart.

## Two paths, one module

This is the single most common source of confusion, so it is worth stating plainly:

| | Path | What lives there |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Source** | `guardrails/` — here, in the kit | The one copy anyone edits. Includes `__tests__/`. |
| **Destination** | `scripts/guardrails/` — in a generated project | What a scaffold copies in. No `__tests__/`. |

`CORE.md`, every stack's `SETUP.md`, the `.claude/settings.json` hooks, and each stack's
`lefthook.yml` all name **`scripts/guardrails/`**, because they describe a generated
project. A root-level `guardrails/` path and a `scripts/guardrails/` path are both correct;
they are source and destination, not old and new.

Until 2026-08 each stack also carried its own byte-identical copy at
`stacks/<stack>/templates/scripts/guardrails/` — five copies, 135 files, kept honest only
by a `diff -r` in CI. Those are gone. There is one source now, and the scaffold reads it
directly.

## What a scaffold copies

The **manifest** — and never `__tests__/`:

```bash
mkdir -p scripts/guardrails
for item in run.sh lib checks patterns schema.json oxlint-plugin; do
  cp -R "$KIT/guardrails/$item" scripts/guardrails/
done
chmod +x scripts/guardrails/run.sh
```

Copy the **whole** set: `run.sh` sources `lib/` and `checks/` from beside itself, so
copying it alone fails at runtime. `__tests__/` is excluded on purpose — it is a
deliberately-violating fixture tree, and shipping it would trip the very gate it exists to
test.

The project then gets its stack's `guardrails.config.json` (from
`stacks/<stack>/templates/`), which is the only per-stack part of the whole arrangement.

## Layout

├── workspace.schema.json  # the guardrails.workspace.json contract (monorepos)
└── __tests__/          # fixtures, plugin and latency suites — kit only, never shipped
```

## Monorepos

A single-repo project has one `guardrails.config.json` at its root. A workspace
has one **per package**, plus a `guardrails.workspace.json` at the root naming
them:

```jsonc
{
  "version": 1,
  "packages": ["packages/api", "packages/database"],
  "bannedDeps": ["axios"],
  "secrets": { "neverTracked": [".dev.vars"] },
  "shadowConfigs": []
}
```

`run.sh` re-execs itself once per package, with the working directory inside it
and `GR_PATH_PREFIX` set, so every check runs in the single-root shape it was
written for and violations still read `packages/database/src/foo.ts`. The four
repo-level checks — `banned-deps`, `shadow-configs`, `required-files`,
`secrets` — run once at the root against the manifest.

Two rules that are load-bearing rather than stylistic:

- **There must be no `guardrails.config.json` at a workspace root.** The oxlint
  plugin resolves that filename from `process.cwd()`, so a root file under that
  name would let a root-level oxlint run lint every package against one config
  and silently disable whatever each package declares `ownedByLinter`. Under
  the manifest's own name, a root-level oxlint run fails closed at plugin load
  instead. Run oxlint per package (`bun --filter '*' run lint`). Having both
  files at the root exits 3.
- **Each package guards its own secrets.** wrangler reads `.dev.vars` beside
  each `wrangler.jsonc`, so every package config lists its own; the manifest
  lists only root-level ones. Listing a package's secret in both makes it
  report twice.

It fails closed in six ways, all exit 3, because each would otherwise leave a
source tree unguarded while the gate reported green: a listed package with no
config; a listed package directory that is absent; an empty `packages` array; a
package path containing `..` (run.sh cd's into these); a package that exists but
is **not** listed, in repo mode or via a `--file` path inside it — its stray
`guardrails.config.json` is the evidence; and both documents at the root.

A `--file` path at the workspace **root** is not one of them. lefthook expands
`{staged_files}` across whatever the commit touched, so treating `package.json`
as an unguarded tree would block every commit that edits it, and there is no
file-addressable check at a workspace root to run against it regardless.

## One rule, one enforcer

Everything a linter *can* see runs inside **oxlint** via the house plugin, so it fires as
the file is written rather than at commit time. Everything else runs here.

`ownedByLinter` in `guardrails.config.json` declares the split, and `gr_selected()` in
`run.sh` skips whatever the linter owns. A check id is the unit of ownership, which is why
`folder-readmes` is split out of `folder-tree` and `test-tree` out of `colocated-tests`: an
id may not straddle what a linter can see and what it cannot.

| | TS stacks (`console` · `marketing` · `backend-ts` · `expo`) | `rust` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ownedByLinter` | `folder-tree` · `colocated-tests` · `no-barrels` · `filename-case` · `patterns` | *(empty)* |
| Runs in oxlint | those five — three as house rules (`house/folder-tree`, `house/colocated-tests`, `house/no-barrels`), `filename-case` as the built-in `unicorn/filename-case`, and `patterns` as `house/no-bare-fetch` + `house/no-hardcoded-hex` + `house/no-module-scope-database` | nothing — oxlint cannot parse Rust |
| Runs here | the remaining eight | all thirteen |
| Needs ast-grep | no — pattern rules run in oxlint | **yes** (`cargo install ast-grep --locked`) |

Two of the five are not one-rule-per-id, which is why `validate-templates.sh` special-cases
them when it checks that a linter-owned id is actually configured: `filename-case` maps to an
oxlint built-in rather than anything in `oxlint-plugin/`, and `patterns` maps to three house
rules at once. The plugin exports six rules — `folder-tree`, `colocated-tests`,
`no-bare-fetch`, `no-barrels`, `no-hardcoded-hex`, `no-module-scope-database` — which is a
different set from the five in the `ownedByLinter` list above; the counts are not meant to
match, and reading one as the other is the mistake this paragraph exists to prevent.

## What differs per stack

Only `guardrails.config.json`. The module itself is identical everywhere:

| | `console` | `marketing` | `backend-ts` | `expo` | `rust` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `srcRoot` | `src` | `src` | `src` | `src` | `src` |
| `src.topLevel` | app · ui · features · api · utilities · providers · constants · types | pages · layouts · sections · ui · content · utilities · constants · types | rpc · routes · services · utilities · constants · types | ui · features · api · utilities · providers · constants · types | *(not tree-checked)* |
| Tests | `__tests__/` colocated | `__tests__/` colocated | `__tests__/` colocated | `__tests__/` colocated | sibling `tests/` |
| File / function ceiling | 300 / 50 | 300 / 50 | 300 / 50 | 300 / 50 | 500 / 100 |
| Banned deps | axios · yup · joi · valibot · superstruct · ajv | same | same | same | *(none listed)* |
| Also carries | — | `requiredFiles` | `requiredFiles` | — | `filenameCase` |

The ceilings are cross-checked against what oxlint and `clippy.toml` actually enforce, by
`scripts/validate-templates.sh` — two numbers for one rule is how they part company.

## Modes and exit codes

```
run.sh                  repo mode  — every check, whole tree. The gate.
run.sh --file <path>…   scoped     — file-addressable checks for those paths
run.sh --hook           PostToolUse — reads hook JSON on stdin, then --file
run.sh --stop           Stop hook  — repo mode behind two early-outs
run.sh --only a,b       run only the named checks (used by the test suite)
run.sh --list           print every check id, one per line
```

`0` clean · `1` violations · `2` violations in a hook mode · `3` misconfigured, which covers
a missing required tool (`jq` everywhere, ast-grep on rust) as well as a bad config.

The `2` is load-bearing, not stylistic: Claude Code ignores a `1` from a hook. Only `2`
shows stderr to the agent on `PostToolUse`, and only `2` blocks on `Stop`. A `--stop` that
exited `1` would leave the whole layer inert while looking correctly wired up.

## Changing a rule

Edit it **here**. A generated project's `scripts/guardrails/` is copied verbatim and never
hand-edited — change that project's `guardrails.config.json` instead. Stack differences are
data, not code; the module is the same file everywhere on purpose.

Then run the suites:

```bash
bash guardrails/__tests__/run-fixtures.sh    # bash checks, on real trees
bash guardrails/__tests__/run-plugin.sh      # the oxlint house plugin, real oxlint
bash guardrails/__tests__/run-latency.sh     # repo < 2000ms, --file < 250ms
```

The first two also run inside `scripts/validate-templates.sh`, which CI runs on every PR.
The latency suite is run by hand: a slow gate gets routed around, so the budget is measured
on a generated 500-file / 20-feature tree rather than on the fixtures.
